George: 

While a majority of the code was adapted from Assignment 3, I wrote the new reg_search.html using 
bootstrap and worked on making the reg_details page open up on a new browser tab. I also wrote the 
JQuery portion of the assignment. 


Shanzay: 

I edited runserver.py and fixed the case of -h. With that, I designed the reg_details.html and 
error.html. Our keystrokes search was not working correctly as it was lagging and not searching
upon input removal, so I edited the JQuery portion.  

Outside Help:
Just python online documentation.

Time Spent: ~3 hours

Assesment of Assignment:

I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment as it increased my knowledge of bootstrap and css in addition to JQuery.
This was very useful as I am currently working with bootstrap for the COS333 project and hence it helped me 
increase my understanding in a simple and easy-to-do manner.
